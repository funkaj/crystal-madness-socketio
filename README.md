## Crystal Madness

A Online 2-player browser based game. Players take turns choosing 1 of 4 numbers hidden under crystals. Their score and the total update. The numbers under the crystals do not change, but will remain hidden. So try and remember where they are. Once a player selection breaks the target number that player losses and the game ends.

I have wanted to learn Socket.io for a while now. But I did not want to do a chat app. Looking over some of my old projects I decided I would make my old crystal game into a online multiplayer game. I wanted to keep it browser based for easy access. That way people could play it with out the need to download.
